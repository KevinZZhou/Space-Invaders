# Space-Invaders
---
## Description
This version of Space Invaders is my final project for CIS 120 at the University of Pennsylvania.  In the game, the user controls a ship at the bottom of the screen.  The objective of the game is to launch shots at the enemy aliens at the top of the screen and defeat all of them without getting by the aliens' bombs and stray asteroids.

This project makes use of several core course concepts, including 2D arrays, collections, inheritance/dynamic dispatch, and JUnit testing.
