# Space-Invaders

## Description
This version of Space Invaders was my final project for CIS 120 (Fall 2020) at the University of Pennsylvania.
This project makes use of several core course concepts, including 2D arrays, collections, inheritance/dynamic dispatch, and JUnit testing.

## Instructions
In this game, you control a ship (green rectangle) at the bottom of the screen.  The objective of the game is to defeat the 8 aliens (black circles) before being defeated yourself!  If you want to play again, just press the Reset button.
                
#### Win Condition
Shoot lasers (black rectangles) at the rows of aliens to defeat all 8 of them, while avoiding the aliens' fast bombs (red circles) and the slow-moving asteroids (grey circles).  Touching one of them will end the game, so don't get hit!
                
#### Controls
Left/Right Arrow Keys - Move the player's ship to the left/right - The ship is not allowed to move out of the bounds of the screen.
Space Bar - Fires the ship's shot - Only one shot can be fired at an alien at a time.
                
#### Messages
You might notice three messages at the bottom of the screen.  These messages provide information on whether the ship has a power-up, the number of aliens remaining on the screen, and the number of shots that the player has shot.  These messages will automatically update as the game goes on.
